<p class="narrative">I didn't believe what I first heard on the news about Tienanmen Square.  But it was true.</p>
<p class="narrative">On the morning of June 4th, I turned on the radio after I woke as usual to listen to the VOA news.  When I heard the news about Tienanmen Square, I dared not believe it was true.  A little later, after my classmates told me it was true, I felt very sad.  Adrift.</p>
<p class="narrative">I imagine what happened in Tienanmen Square: many students and people killed; dead bodies were everywhere.  Tears fall from my eyes. I have nothing to say.</p>

<p class="narrative">I knew the news as soon as it broadcasted by VOA.  I was shocked.  I can hardly believe it.  Unfortunately it is true.  It is our people's government but they shot us with real bullets!  What a shame!  I think no sane human being can do this.  I have nothing more to say.  If I can bare this, I can bare everything!</p>
<p class="narrative">Today, I have been to many factories.  I talked with many workers.  I asked them to go on strike.  They all say, they hate the government very much but they are afraid of the government's army.</p>
<p class="narrative">I will do all I can do for this Democratic movement!</p>

<p class="narrative">The news surprised me and made me very sad.  As I lay in bed on the early morning of June 4th, I listened to VOA report that the PLA soldiers shot the unarmed people in Beijing and many people were killed.  I couldn't believe my ears.  I seemed to see our brave students flowing blood from their wounds.  I felt ill. I didn't want to have breakfast all the morning</p>

<p class="narrative">I shall remember the day 1989, June 4th.</p>
<p class="narrative">I was surprised to hear that soldiers killed a thousand people in Beijing.  I could hardly believed my ears.  But soon, I knew it was true.  I was very angry and could not eat my breakfast that morning.  I listened to the radio, Voice of America, in my room.  And I heard the things I hoped would not happen come about.  I hated the Government and the Army.  I shall remember the day forever: 1989, June 4.  All people of our Nation and the World will remember the events that happened that day.</p>

<p class="narrative">On last Sunday morning, I heard about Tienanmen Square events on TV.  I was extremely shocked.  I can't believe that such things happened in China. It is unique since the Liberation of China.  I am not only sad and torn, but also worried about the future of China.  For our future, we don't expect such things to take place thing in China.  We need a steady environment.  Who will responsible for this?  Both the government and the students have a duty.  I hope that every one will keep a calm and clear mind -- especially calm.</p>

<p class="narrative">My expectations are broken.  When the I heard of the events on June 4th in Tienanmen Square, my ideas became fully wrong.  I thought that the Government would treat the problem as the students said, "with talking way".  But the Government took the weapon, shooting the students.  My faith is a broken a bit.  What a government!  They are the most shameful in the Nation.  I went to the street shouting "We want safer and free."</p>

<p class="narrative">June 4th  is  the darkest day in the history of China.  I have been very upset by what happened in Tienanmen Square.  I did disbelieve that PLA had killed thousands of students and people in Tienamen Square when I heard the news as I listened to the radio in bed on the morning of 4th.  But it was indeed People's Army that killed people and students who had nothing to fight with.  That was unique in the world's history.  It proves that the Government has not been the government of us and the Army has not been the army of us.</p>
<p class="narrative">I am even more angry that the government still covers the facts and cheats our people.  I think that facts can never be covered.  People will know facts at last.  People can not be killed thoroughly.  One person falls down more people will catch up with him.  Our people and students have no other choice than to fight.  Stand up all strong hearted people and students.  We need fighting, fighting, and fighting.</p>

<p class="narrative">When I returned to our university from home in the afternoon of June 4th to take part in the evening class as usual, I heard the news about Tienanmen Square from the loudspeaker broadcast of our campus.  I was shocked. I couldn't believe it, but I knew it was true.  Many people stood here and there, talking about such an evil of the Government.  I just wanted to cry.  I could say nothing.  As a student believing in Buddhism, I hadn't taken part in any political party and I didn't care about the differences between the Students and Government.  But I always pray that the problem can be solved in a peaceful way.  However, my idea became a bubble. Thousands of students were killed by the Government.  I can say nothing.</p>
<p class="narrative">June 4th.  The whole world will never forget the day!  The greatest yet darkest day in the human history.</p>

<p class="narrative">When I first heard the news about Tiananmen Square, I joined many teachers and students to march on the street in protest.  We denounced the Government's offense of killing the students.  And, I wrote a paper that helped the students strike.</p>

<p class="narrative">It was dawn on June 4th when I heard the worst news from VOA and BBC in my dormitory.  I was shocked.  I never thought the government would take such measure on its own people and students.  I was silent for a long time.  I didn't declare any point of view to my roommates until I went to work.  Afterwards, I acquired other news about the events.  The more I heard, the more anguish I felt.  At noon, I ate very little food.  I didn't want to eat anything. From afternoon to night, I was deep into this sorrow all the time.  I feel there is no hope in China.  I don't know how long until democracy will come in China, when this unfortunate event will end, or what result it will be.</p>

<p class="narrative">It was Sunday morning.  I got up at 7:45; although, I wanted to stay on bed longer.  My English is not good, so I think I should listen to the program "English on Sunday".  There weren't any clouds in the sky and the sun was bright.  After the program was over, I should have turned off the radio as usual but I didn't.  I don't know why.  When I heard the news services, I was surprised.  I didn't believe my ears.  "very, very bitter people... mad... soldiers were killed..." how about the students, the citizens.  There wasn't any words about them.  They hadn't any weapons.  I was very worried about them.  I was disappointed with the Government.  This action showed that I...  I am sorry I can't write any more.</p>

<p class="narrative">June 4th a date we can't forget ever.</p>
<p class="narrative">Yesterday morning at 8:30, I wanted to listen to news on radio.  While I was choosing the channel, I heard the sound of Taiwan's "Freedom China".  The woman said in Chinese that "It was supposed that there were about 10,000 persons were killed and countless persons were injured and disappeared..."  I was surprised by that? I turned the radio on correct channel and listened to the news carefully.  With the broadcasting of the news, I felt very sad more and more.  My tears flowed down along my face.  I mourned the fellows who had died and hated the cruel Government very much.  I thought that this was the most miserable day of China in history.  Why do the people keep silent at that?  We should fight against them.  We should kill all the soldiers who killed the students.</p>

<p class="narrative">That is a Sunday on June 4th.  I got up very early in the morning.  I often spend the whole morning in bed on Sunday.  My father told me there was some news about Tiananmen on TV.   I knew something had happened in Beijing after the news.  From the news, I already knew there are some PLA men who died.</p>
<p class="narrative">Of course, there was not any news about the students.  But, I knew the news was controlled by the Government.  I believe many students died when the PLA troops went into Tienanmen Square.  I was so angry about that.  I knew that the student's already wanted to leave Tienanmen Square.  But, why did the troops still want to go into the Square?  It should have some right happen.  I couldn't believe my ears.  I don't think it's a truth.  I thought I must make sure what's going on in Beijing, so I went to see my classmate.  But he was strange, by himself.  So we decided to go into town to get some news.   Finally, we knew what had happened when we talked with the students who were on the street.</p>

<p class="narrative">I was shocked!  I couldn't believe what I heard!!  But it IS the truth!!  The Government makes everyone who has a kind hope disappointed.  Remember today June 4th.  The Chinese Government and its Army troops shot students and citizens without any humanity!  That's the tragedy of our Country and the tragedy of the whole world!</p>
<p class="narrative">At the noon, we heard the news from one of my classmates who stays still in Beijing.  He said another classmate of ours was shot in his knee yesterday.  We all cried.  In the afternoon, we went to the street and heard the crowd shouting angry slogans.  At the same time, we heard people say "It's high time that every Chinese unites together and fights for a new democratic and free China."</p>
<p class="narrative">We sorrow for the brave people who died in Beijing.  The crazy massacre won't last too long.  Victory belongs to people!</p>

<p class="narrative">After a happy weekend, I was still in sleep that morning.  When suddenty the loudspeaker called and woke me.  The student radio broadcast a horrible news:  "The soldiers fired at students and several hundred people were killed or injured in Tienanmen Square."  I was shocked.  I hadn't thought that Deng could have made such a decision.  A few days ago, two Marshals promised that the PLA wouldn't fire at students.  And these days nothing special has happened in Beijing.  I thought all things would get better.  But...</p>
<p class="narrative">I began to worry about my best friend.  She is a student in Beijing University and interested in politics very much.  She must have been in the Square that night.  How about her?!  I can't go on!</p>

<p class="narrative">When I first heard the news about Tienanmen Square on June 4th, I was at home and watched TV.  I was so surprised that I couldn't help asking, why?...</p>
<p class="narrative">I was sad to hear the news and worried about many college students.  I really don't know whether they are alive or dead.  I really don't know how Beijing is.  Because I don't hear or watch real conditions on paper and TV.</p>
<p class="narrative">When I went out home, I saw lots of workers, students, citizens were on the street.  Many people joined the parade.</p>
<p class="narrative">However, I mostly worry where my Motherland will go towards.</p>

<p class="narrative">I'm mournful and astonished at the news about Tienanmen Square on BBC and VOA.  Being a governmental official, Li Peng should not take gun against the People.  I think he must be mad.  Now I have nothing more to say. Except some shouts from my heart.</p>
<p class="narrative">Stand up, people being oppressed.</p>
<p class="narrative">Stand up, people who don't want to be a slave.</p>
<p class="narrative">Go together asking for Democracy.  Asking for Liberty!</p>
