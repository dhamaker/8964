I was shocked!  I couldn't believe what I heard!!  But it IS the truth!!  The Government makes everyone who has a kind hope disappointed.  Remember today June 4th.  The Chinese Government and its Army troops shot students and citizens without any humanity!  That's the tragedy of our Country and the tragedy of the whole world!

At the noon, we heard the news from one of my classmates who stays still in Beijing.  He said another classmate of ours was shot in his knee yesterday.  We all cried.  In the afternoon, we went to the street and heard the crowd shouting angry slogans.  At the same time, we heard people say "It's high time that every Chinese unites together and fights for a new democratic and free China."

We sorrow for the brave people who died in Beijing.  The crazy massacre won't last too long.  Victory belongs to people!
