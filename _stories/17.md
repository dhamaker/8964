After a happy weekend, I was still in sleep that morning.  When suddenty the loudspeaker called and woke me.  The student radio broadcast a horrible news:  "The soldiers fired at students and several hundred people were killed or injured in Tienanmen Square."  I was shocked.  I hadn't thought that Deng could have made such a decision.  A few days ago, two Marshals promised that the PLA wouldn't fire at students.  And these days nothing special has happened in Beijing.  I thought all things would get better.  But...

I began to worry about my best friend.  She is a student in Beijing University and interested in politics very much.  She must have been in the Square that night.  How about her?!  I can't go on!
