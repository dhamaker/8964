I shall remember the day 1989, June 4th.

I was surprised to hear that soldiers killed a thousand people in Beijing.  I could hardly believed my ears.  But soon, I knew it was true.  I was very angry and could not eat my breakfast that morning.  I listened to the radio, Voice of America, in my room.  And I heard the things I hoped would not happen come about.  I hated the Government and the Army.  I shall remember the day forever: 1989, June 4.  All people of our Nation and the World will remember the events that happened that day.
