When I returned to our university from home in the afternoon of June 4th to take part in the evening class as usual, I heard the news about Tienanmen Square from the loudspeaker broadcast of our campus.  I was shocked. I couldn't believe it, but I knew it was true.  Many people stood here and there, talking about such an evil of the Government.  I just wanted to cry.  I could say nothing.  As a student believing in Buddhism, I hadn't taken part in any political party and I didn't care about the differences between the Students and Government.  But I always pray that the problem can be solved in a peaceful way.  However, my idea became a bubble. Thousands of students were killed by the Government.  I can say nothing.

June 4th.  The whole world will never forget the day!  The greatest yet darkest day in the human history.
