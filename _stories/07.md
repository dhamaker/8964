June 4th  is  the darkest day in the history of China.  I have been very upset by what happened in Tienanmen Square.  I did disbelieve that PLA had killed thousands of students and people in Tienamen Square when I heard the news as I listened to the radio in bed on the morning of 4th.  But it was indeed People's Army that killed people and students who had nothing to fight with.  That was unique in the world's history.  It proves that the Government has not been the government of us and the Army has not been the army of us.

I am even more angry that the government still covers the facts and cheats our people.  I think that facts can never be covered.  People will know facts at last.  People can not be killed thoroughly.  One person falls down more people will catch up with him.  Our people and students have no other choice than to fight.  Stand up all strong hearted people and students.  We need fighting, fighting, and fighting.
