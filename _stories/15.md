Today is June 4th 1989, Sunday.  As usually, I got up at 6:30 then turn on the radio.  Suddenly, a news made me so suprise that I didn't utter a word.  "The China Government has begun press student and mass.  Those soldier hit student by gun."  This thing is never Imagination.  I said repeatly for me but matter is real.  I sad all the day.  It is very miserable.  I can never forget the day!

Then I hear of these thing as a whole.  It is said that the soldiers began entrance Tienanmin Square about 5:00am.  They killed many students and mass.  I don't know they have anything mistake.  They fighted for freedom.  Although they died, their spirit is forever.  We never give up.  "Down of the         the freedom belongs to people."
