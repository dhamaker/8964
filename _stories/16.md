As I am writing this paper, many, many people and students without any weapons have been shot by the Army in Tienanmen Square.  Each of us who are honest men cannot keep silent.  Hearing the news from the loudspeaker, I cannot help crying and shooting with a gun at Li Peng who is a wild animal!!!  A wild Wolf!!!

The Disaster-Ridden Chinese People!!! STAND UP!!!

We have many, many people who support us.  Our demands are the most basic rights as a person.  To fight for Democracy and Human rights!  STAND UP!!
