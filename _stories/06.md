My expectations are broken.  When the I heard of the events on June 4th in Tienanmen Square, my ideas became fully wrong.  I thought that the Government would treat the problem as the students said, "with talking way".  But the Government took the weapon, shooting the students.  My faith is a broken a bit.  What a government!  They are the most shameful in the Nation.  I went to the street shouting "We want safer and free."
