When I first heard the news about Tienanmen Square on June 4th, I was at home and watched TV.  I was so surprised that I couldn't help asking, why?...

I was sad to hear the news and worried about many college students.  I really don't know whether they are alive or dead.  I really don't know how Beijing is.  Because I don't hear or watch real conditions on paper and TV.

When I went out home, I saw lots of workers, students, citizens were on the street.  Many people joined the parade.

However, I mostly worry where my Motherland will go towards.
