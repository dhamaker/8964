I didn't believe what I first heard on the news about Tienanmen Square.  But it was true.

On the morning of June 4th, I turned on the radio after I woke as usual to listen to the VOA news.  When I heard the news about Tienanmen Square, I dared not believe it was true.  A little later, after my classmates told me it was true, I felt very sad.  Adrift.

I imagine what happened in Tienanmen Square: many students and people killed; dead bodies were everywhere.  Tears fall from my eyes. I have nothing to say.
