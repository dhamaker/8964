It was dawn on June 4th when I heard the worst news from VOA and BBC in my dormitory.  I was shocked.  I never thought the government would take such measure on its own people and students.  I was silent for a long time.  I didn't declare any point of view to my roommates until I went to work.  Afterwards, I acquired other news about the events.  The more I heard, the more anguish I felt.  At noon, I ate very little food.  I didn't want to eat anything. From afternoon to night, I was deep into this sorrow all the time.  I feel there is no hope in China.  I don't know how long until democracy will come in China, when this unfortunate event will end, or what result it will be.
