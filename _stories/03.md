The news surprised me and made me very sad.  As I lay in bed on the early morning of June 4th, I listened to VOA report that the PLA soldiers shot the unarmed people in Beijing and many people were killed.  I couldn't believe my ears.  I seemed to see our brave students flowing blood from their wounds.  I felt ill. I didn't want to have breakfast all the morning.
