I knew the news as soon as it broadcasted by VOA.  I was shocked.  I can hardly believe it.  Unfortunately it is true.  It is our people's government but they shot us with real bullets!  What a shame!  I think no sane human being can do this.  I have nothing more to say.  If I can bare this, I can bare everything!

Today, I have been to many factories.  I talked with many workers.  I asked them to go on strike.  They all say, they hate the government very much but they are afraid of the government's army.

I will do all I can do for this Democratic movement!
