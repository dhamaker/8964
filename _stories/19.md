[Sorry the paper is not good, because my mind isn't here.]

I'm mournful and astonished at the news about Tienanmen Square on BBC and VOA.  Being a governmental official, Li Peng should not take gun against the People.  I think he must be mad.  Now I have nothing more to say. Except some shouts from my heart.

Stand up, people being oppressed.

Stand up, people who don't want to be a slave.

Go together asking for Democracy.  Asking for Liberty!

Go on. Go on, until we win the fight against the damn government!

Dammit! Li Peng! Deng Xiao Ping!
