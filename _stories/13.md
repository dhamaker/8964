That is a Sunday on June 4th.  I got up very early in the morning.  I often spend the whole morning in bed on Sunday.  My father told me there was some news about Tiananmen on TV.   I knew something had happened in Beijing after the news.  From the news, I already knew there are some PLA men who died.

Of course, there was not any news about the students.  But, I knew the news was controlled by the Government.  I believe many students died when the PLA troops went into Tienanmen Square.  I was so angry about that.  I knew that the student's already wanted to leave Tienanmen Square.  But, why did the troops still want to go into the Square?  It should have some right happen.  I couldn't believe my ears.  I don't think it's a truth.  I thought I must make sure what's going on in Beijing, so I went to see my classmate.  But he was strange, by himself.  So we decided to go into town to get some news.   Finally, we knew what had happened when we talked with the students who were on the street.
