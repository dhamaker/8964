On last Sunday morning, I heard about Tienanmen Square events on TV.  I was extremely shocked.  I can't believe that such things happened in China. It is unique since the Liberation of China.  I am not only sad and torn, but also worried about the future of China.  For our future, we don't expect such things to take place thing in China.  We need a steady environment.  Who will responsible for this?  Both the government and the students have a duty.  I hope that every one will keep a calm and clear mind -- especially calm.
