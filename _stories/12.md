Yesterday morning at 8:30, I wanted to listen to news on radio.  While I was choosing the channel, I heard the sound of Taiwan's "Freedom China".  The woman said in Chinese that "It was supposed that there were about 10,000 persons were killed and countless persons were injured and disappeared..."  I was surprised by that? I turned the radio on correct channel and listened to the news carefully.  With the broadcasting of the news, I felt very sad more and more.  My tears flowed down along my face.  I mourned the fellows who had died and hated the cruel Government very much.  I thought that this was the most miserable day of China in history.  Why do the people keep silent at that?  We should fight against them.  We should kill all the soldiers who killed the students.
